## OOP [Object-Oriented Programming]
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, 
while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

## Java Classes/Objects
Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 

For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has **attributes**, such as weight and color, and **methods**, such as drive and brake
## Java Constructors
A constructor in Java is a special method that is **used to initialize objects.** The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
Constructor Parameters :- Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes.
## Encapsulation
Make sure that **"sensitive"** data is hidden from users . Refers to integrating data (variables) and code (methods) into a **single unit**
## Inheritance
mechanism in which one (child)object **acquires** all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
## Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. 
 Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
 ## Interface
 A Blueprint of a class. A mechanism to achieve abstraction. It has static constants and abstract methods.
 ## Exceptions
 When executing Java code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.

The **try** statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

The **catch** statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
## Threads
Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.
Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.
